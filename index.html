            <b>Hi! My name is Trevar</b> and I am a software engineer with a
            strong passion for learning and building applications that make a
            difference. Originally from Greencastle, Indiana, I now reside in
            Brownsburg, Indiana with my wife Jessica and two children; Adalyn
            (9) and Blakely (1).
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy opportunities to lead and help others grow. By teaching
            others I am able to expand my influence beyond what a
            single person can contribute. While contributing technically with
            NoSQL databases, JavaScript development, and Pega development I have
            often found myself in positions where I am organizing and
            leading teams in agile adoption, devops practices, and automated
            testing initiatives.

              <p>
                My weekends are filled with family activities. From going on bike rides with my oldest daughter Adalyn
                to driving RC cars with my youngest - Blakely, I tend to stay pretty busy. When the dust settles and the
                kiddos go to bed - my wife Jessica and I like to relax in the evenings talking about our day, playing
                games, or binging on the netflix series of the year (currently 'Criminal Minds').

              <h4><i class="material-icons">drive_eta</i> Road Trips</h4>
              <p>
                Cars are a passion of mine - or more so the ability to explore and see where the road takes you. I like
                to explore new places, whether that means taking a different road home from work, or traveling hundreds
                of miles away to see what there is to see. If I had all of the time and money in the world I would
                probably spend a decent amount of that time traveling. My family enjoys to go on road trips when we are
                able.
              </p>
              <p> It has been a couple of years since our last big road trip, but in 2018 we were able to go on the
                road trip of a lifetime seeing a great amount of the western United States. To give an idea of what I
                mean when I say road
                trip, during this excursion we covered over 6000 miles in 9 days.
                Starting in Indiana, we traveled to Fort Worth, Texas for a wedding. Over the next week, we
                experienced...
                <ul>
                  <li>- Off-roading in the Arizona desert</li>
                  <li>- Viewing the Grand Canyon</li>
                  <li>- Visiting Glenn Canyon Dam</li>
                  <li>- Driving through Zion National Park</li>
                  <li>- Tackling the blistering heat hiking at Arches National Park in Moab, Utah</li>
                  <li>- Venturing through the mountains near Salt Lake City</li>
                  <li>- Hiking in Grand Teton National Park</li>
                  <li>- Choked on the sulfuric air at Yellowstone National Park</li>
                  <li>- Drove into the clouds on Beartooth Pass</li>
                  <li>- Saw 'Faces on Rocks'-Adalyn aka Mount Rushmore</li>
                </ul>
                ... and finally ending it all with a LONG drive back across the Dakotas and plain states to Indiana.

                As my youngest daughter grows older we plan to get back to
                our adventures. Our future plans are to explore the Northeastern U.S. since my wife (who grew
                up in Texas) hasn't been to many of the eastern states. After
                that, I aim to head back north to Montana again to soak in the mountain air, then another
                trip exploring the far west coast through California, up to
                Washington. At some point I hope to drive to Alaska, and have
                always had a dream of buying a car just to drive south as far
                as I could get in to south america and fly back home.

                <i class="material-icons">settings</i> Mechanical Interests
              </h4>
              <p>
                I've always been very mechanically focused. I've always
                tinkered with things and grew up taking things apart and
                putting them back together to see how they work. This fueled
                by my love of racing videogames when I was younger made me in
                to somewhat of a gear-head.</p>
              <p>
                When I was 15, my parents got me my first car: a 2000 Chevy Cavalier with a
                cracked engine block that I started repairing as I looked forward to being able to drive. I
                purchased a totalled parts car with a good engine and
                interior, swapped the interior components (from a different
                model year) into my 2000, and swapped engines replacing all
                major seals and components. I redid the interior
                to be 'cool' or as cool as I thought it was when I was 15,
                with speakers in the dash and painting interior panels. Some of these things that I once thought were
                cool, now seem somewhat juvenile, but I walked away with a plethora of knowledge, confidence, and value
                in good workmanship. Working on that Cavalier
                taught me to care for things even if they are small. It taught
                me hard work, and in general helped to teach me mechanical and
                electrical skills.
              </p>
              <p> I had strong interests in high
                school in aeronautical engineering and was planning to go to
                Rose Hulman or Purdue University majoring in aeronautical or
                mechanical engineering. At the time, I decided to pursue a secondary passion of mine: technology.
                I instead majored in computer science where I could build on my problem solving and tinkering
                attributes. While I enjoy technology and computer science, a personal goal of mine is to tie in my
                technological skills into a mechanical industry through embedded systems or related area of work.

                    where we previously had no experience with. In an effort
                    to improve our websites, I explored ADA compliance, what
                    it means, levels of compliance, etc to educate others in
                    our design and frontend space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After gather necessary information on ADA compliance, I
                    did a full audit of our websites pinpointing level of
                    compliance by site (by compliance requirement), and
                    illustrating next best steps to get to WCAG 2.1 AA
                    compliance level on all sites.
