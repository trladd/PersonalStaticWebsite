              <b>Hi! My name is Trevar</b> and I am a software engineer with a
              strong passion for learning and building applications that make a
              difference. Originally from Greencastle Indiana, I live in
              Brownsburg Indiana with my wife Jessica and two children Adalyn
              (9) and Blakely (1).
            </p>

            <p>
              I enjoy opportunities to lead and grow others. While learning is a
              passion of mine, something I enjoy more than learning is helping
              to grow others by sharing that knowledge with them. By teaching
              and growing others I am able to expand my influence beyond what a
              single person can contribute. While contributing technically with
              NoSQL databases, JavaScript development, Pega development I have
              often found myself in positions where I am helping organize and
              lead teams in agile adoption, devops practices, and automated
              testing initiatives.

                <p>
                  Much of my time is spent with my family. I am married to my
                  wife Jessica and live in Brownsburg Indiana. Having two young
                  children tends to keep me pretty busy from going on family
                  'adventures' to playing outside in the yard.

                <p>
                  Cars are a passion of mine. I've always had an interest in
                  cars and motorsports. With that I also enjoy driving quite a
                  bit. If I had all of the time and money in the world I would
                  probably spend a decent amount of that time traveling and
                  exploring. My family enjoys to go on road trips when we are
                  able. It has been a couple of years since we've been able to
                  go on a big road trip but in 2018 we were able to go on the
                  road trip of a lifetime seeing a great amount of America's
                  western states. To give an idea of what I mean when I say road
                  trip, during this trip we covered over 6000 miles in 9 days.
                  From Indiana, through Texas for a wedding then through New
                  Mexico and Arizona to Meteor Crater and the Grand Canyon. Then
                  to Zion national park, arches national park, salt lake city,
                  zion national park, yellowstone national park, beartooth pass,
                  mount rushmore, and finally a long drive back home across the
                  plains states.

                  As my youngest daughter grows older we plan to get back to
                  traveling and exploring. Some of our next road trips will lead
                  us to explore the the eastern states since my wife (who grew
                  up in Texas) hasn't been to many of the eastern states. After
                  that I aim to head back north to Montana again, then another
                  trip exploring the far west coast through California, up to
                  Washington. At some point I hope to drive to Alaska, and have
                  always had a dream of buying a car just to drive south as far
                  as I could get in to south america and fly back home.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  I've always been very mechanically focused. I've always
                  tinkered with things and grew up taking things apart and
                  putting them back together to see how they work. This fueled
                  by my love of racing videogames when I was younger made me in
                  to somewhat of a gear-head. I had strong interests in high
                  school in aeronautical engineering and was planning to go to
                  Rose Hulman or Perdue University majoring in aeronautical or
                  mechanical engineering. Based on advisement of others I
                  instead chose to pursue a path majoring in computer science
                  and while I learned a lot at IUPUI majoring in computer
                  science, everything I learned was still rooted in my interests
                  in mechanical, physical engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My parents got me my first car: a 2000 Chevy Cavalier with a
                  cracked block that I started repairing when I was 15. I
                  purchased a totalled parts car with a good engine and
                  interior, swapped the interior components (from a different
                  model year) into my 2000, and swapped engines replacing all
                  major seals and components at the time. I redid the interior
                  to be 'cool' or as cool as I thought it was when I was 15,
                  with speakers in the dash and painting interior panels. While
                  looking back this car was very silly, it taught me a lot. It
                  taught me to care for things even if they are small. It taught
                  me hard work, and in general helped to teach me mechanical and
                  electrical skills.

                    file configurations, test cases, and more. This utility
                    would build out over 30 files and 900 lines of code with
                    just 7 inputs. This program features cached data via local
                    files, an installation program that sets up the developer

                    building out the application, I was able to gain team
                    adoption where the full team was using it and contributing

                  <p>
                    I was tasked with setting up a Pega competency at my company
                    where there was initially none internal to the company. We
                    started by hiring Pega resources, but communication gaps and
                    development performance quickly became a concern. I inserted
                    myself into the process and the problems at hand helping to
                    work through them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In one year's time, I helped solidify a pega competency,
                    lead a strategy for implementing devops with in our Pega
                    development space, built out our first large production
                    application, and achieved my Pega Certified Systems
                    Architect and Pega Certified Senior Systems Architect
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From there on I would oversee onboarding for new resources,
                    overall Pega architecture, application maintenance, building
                    out reusable Pega rulesets such as an advanced integration
                    with DocuSign for company applications.

                      I was tasked with exploring ADA compliance for my company
                      where we previously had no experience with. In an effort
                      to improve our websites, I explored ADA compliance, what
                      it means, levels of compliance, etc to educate others in
                      our design and frontend space.

                    <p>
                      After gather necessary information on ADA compliance, I
                      did a full audit of our websites pinpointing level of
                      compliance by site (by compliance requirement), and
                      illustrating next best steps to get to WCAG 2.1 AA
                      compliance level on all sites.
